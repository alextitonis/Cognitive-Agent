## How to train a new model
Create a folder, inside create 2 new folders called test and train, inside each add the same folders with the names of the images (car, human, etc)
For example:
trees/train/pine
trees/train/oak
trees/test/pine
trees/test/oak

Train images should be atleast 500, while the test folder should include atleast 200 images to train a proper model.
